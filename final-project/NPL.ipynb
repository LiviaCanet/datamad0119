       "2/0/2003: In a series of seven related incidents, between mid-February to mid-May 2003, a total of thirty-two European 'adventure tourists' travelling through the Illizi and Tamanghasset provinces of Algeria were kidnapped by the Free Salafist Group faction of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Fighting (GSPC).  On May 13, 2003, seventeen of the hostages were freed following a gun battle between Algerian security forces and the assailants in the Illizi province.  It is believed that nine out of the eighteen hostage takers were killed during this assault.  The remaining hostages were transported to Mali.  One of these hostages, a German woman, died from heat stroke and six other hostages became critically ill.  The rest of the fourteen hostages were eventually released on August 18, 2003, after a ransom of 4.6 million euros (5.2 million dollars) was paid to the perpetrators.                                                                                                     5\n",
